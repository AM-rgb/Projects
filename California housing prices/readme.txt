This project is working with the California Housing Prices dataset. I first visualize and analyze the dataset. I then clean,
preprocess, and make a transformation pipeline to automate this process in the future. lastly, I construct an ensemble model,
a Random Forest Regressor, use the GridSearchCV method to validate and find the best hyperparameters to use, and compute the rmse
and accuracy of the model.
